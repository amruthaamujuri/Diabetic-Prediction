# Predicting-type-and-risk-level-of-diabetes
The project, which focuses on predicting the risk and type of diabetes using machine learning, aims to help healthcare professionals identify individuals at risk and determine the type of diabetes they may have.

1. Problem Statement
The goal of the project is to develop a machine learning model that:

Predicts the type of diabetes (Type 1, Type 2, or Gestational Diabetes) a person has or is likely to develop.
Predicts the risk level of diabetes (e.g., Low, Medium, or High) based on certain health and lifestyle parameters.
This can be particularly useful in preventive healthcare, where early diagnosis can help in better management of the condition.

2. Dataset

Demographic features: Age, Gender, Ethnicity
Lifestyle factors: Diet, Physical activity, Smoking habits
Medical history: Family history of diabetes, Hypertension
Clinical data: Body Mass Index (BMI), Blood Pressure, Blood Sugar Levels, Cholesterol Levels, Insulin Levels
The target variables in your dataset would be:

Type of Diabetes: A classification label indicating whether the person has Type 1, Type 2, or Gestational diabetes.
Risk Level: A classification label indicating the risk level (Low, Medium, High) of the person developing diabetes.


3. Data Preprocessing
Before feeding the data into the machine learning models, preprocessing steps would have been applied, such as:

Handling Missing Values: Removing or imputing missing data.
Data Normalization/Standardization: Scaling numeric features to ensure consistent ranges across features.
Encoding Categorical Data: Converting categorical variables like gender or ethnicity into numerical form using techniques like one-hot encoding.
Splitting the dataset: Dividing the dataset into training and testing sets for model evaluation.


4. Feature Selection
To ensure the model focuses on the most relevant information, you likely used feature selection techniques such as:

Correlation Analysis: Identifying features that are highly correlated with diabetes risk or type.
Feature Importance: Using techniques like feature importance from tree-based models or LASSO regularization to select important features.


5. Model Selection
For the classification task, you may have experimented with different machine learning algorithms, such as:

Logistic Regression: Simple and interpretable, good for binary and multiclass classification.
Decision Trees or Random Forests: Effective in handling complex relationships between features and useful for understanding feature importance.
Support Vector Machines (SVM): Suitable for classification with high-dimensional data.
Gradient Boosting: Algorithms like XGBoost or LightGBM, which are powerful for classification tasks with high accuracy.
You might have used separate models for predicting the diabetes type and diabetes risk, or you might have used multi-output classification to predict both simultaneously.

6. Model Training and Evaluation
The models were trained using the training dataset and evaluated using metrics such as:

Accuracy: The percentage of correct predictions.
Precision and Recall: To understand how well the model detects true positives while avoiding false positives.
F1 Score: The harmonic mean of precision and recall, especially useful for imbalanced datasets.
Confusion Matrix: To visualize the performance of classification models by showing true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives.
ROC-AUC Curve: To evaluate the modelâ€™s ability to distinguish between the classes.


7. Risk Level Prediction
The risk level of diabetes (Low, Medium, or High) would have been predicted based on factors like:

BMI: High BMI often correlates with a higher risk of Type 2 diabetes.
Family History: A family history of diabetes increases the risk.
Blood Glucose Levels: Elevated levels suggest a higher risk of diabetes.
Physical Activity: Sedentary lifestyle is associated with a higher risk.


8. Type of Diabetes Prediction
To predict the type of diabetes (Type 1, Type 2, or Gestational), the model would look at factors such as:

Age: Type 1 diabetes is more common in children, whereas Type 2 is more common in adults.
Insulin Levels: People with Type 1 diabetes tend to have lower insulin production.
Pregnancy: Gestational diabetes occurs only during pregnancy.
Conclusion:
A model that can predict the type of diabetes a person is likely to have, with a certain level of accuracy.
A model that can predict the risk of developing diabetes, helping healthcare providers focus on high-risk individuals for early interventions.
